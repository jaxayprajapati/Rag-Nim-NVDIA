## Introduction

The NVIDIA NIM RAG Module leverages the capabilities of the NVIDIA NIM framework to implement a sophisticated RAG system. This system retrieves relevant information from a large dataset and generates high-quality responses using state-of-the-art natural language models.

## Features

- **Efficient Retrieval**: Utilizes vector stores for fast and accurate information retrieval.
- **High-Quality Generation**: Employs advanced natural language models to generate coherent and context-aware responses.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and scale efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Easily customizable for different use cases and datasets.

## Architecture

The RAG module consists of two main components:

1. **Retriever**: Uses vector embeddings to retrieve relevant documents based on the input query.
2. **Generator**: Generates a response by combining the retrieved information with a natural language model.

The following diagram illustrates the RAG architecture:

```
